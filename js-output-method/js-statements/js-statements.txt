what is javascript statements?


 ans:  javascript statements are used to check conditions or true and false or check loop etc.

types of statements:
      
      a) conditions statements:
           1) if:
                  if is executed when conditions is true
            syntex:
                     if(conditions)
                     {
                        statements;
                     }

           2) if else:
                    if else statements: if is executed when conditions is true when conditions is false else is executed
               syntex:
                       if(conditions)
                       {
                         statements;
                       }
                        else
                        {
                          statements;
                        }
           3) nested if :
                      condition within another condition there we used nested if conditions.
                syntex:
                       if(condition)
                       {
                        if(condition)
                        {
                          statements;
                        }
                       } 
                       else 
                       {
                        statements;
                       }
           4) if else if:
                       if else if statements: if is executed when conditions is true else if is executed  while check multiple true condition when condition is true  executed multipes time when condition is false else is executed

                syntex:
                      if(condition)
                      {
                        statements;
                      }
                      else if(condition)
                      {
                        statements;
                      }
                      else if(condition)
                      {
                        statements;
                      }
                      else if(condition)
                      {
                        statements;
                      }
                      else
                      {
                        statements;
                      }
                    
           5) switch:
                    switch just like if else if where we check multiple condition at once time here we make case forcheck true condition if condition is false default is executed
                  syntex:
                        switch (condition)
                        {
                          case 'A';
                          statements;
                          break;

                          default;
                          break;
                    
                        }     
      B) looping statements:
                        loop are used to print number of iterations  again and again or repeted more than once time there we apply loop 

           1) for :
                    for loop is executed when condition is true 
               syntex:
                     for(intliazation;conditions;increment/decrement)
                     {
                      statements;
                     }


           2) foreach:
                     array is stored data inside of []
                     array is  used to stored multiple data in a single variables there we used array 
                     foreach convert array as  values 
                  syntex:
                        array.foreach(element)
                        {
                          statements;
                        }

                      array.foreach(callback function());


                        
           3) nested loop:
                         loop within another loopis called nested loop.
                  syntex:
                         for(intliazation;condition;increment)
                         {
                          for( intliazation;condition;increment)
                          {
                            statements;
                          }
                         }
           4) while :
                     when condition is true while loop are executed
                  syntex:
                          while(condition);
                          {
                            statements;
                            increment/decrement;
                          }
           5) do while: 
                       do will be executed one time  while condition is true or false when condition is true while loop are executed.
                  syntex:
                         do
                         {
                            statements;
                            increment/decrement;
                         }
                         while(condition)

      c) jumping statements:
           1) break:
                syntex:
                        var i;
                        for(statements)
                        {
                          if(condition)
                          {
                            break;
                          }
                          document.write("statements");
                        }

           2) continue
